title: "Reference Types (externref)"
description: "Hold references to host objects and use function references."
---

This extension lets Wasm store references to host objects (`externref`) and introduces more flexible function references. See the Language page for fundamentals.

- Start here: [/reference-types/](/reference-types/)
- Use with tables and `call_indirect` for dynamic dispatch.
