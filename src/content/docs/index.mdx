WAT is the human-readable text representation of WebAssembly modules. It mirrors the binary format closely while remaining friendly enough to read, write, and learn from.

This site focuses on:

- Types: the values functions accept and return
- Operators: core instructions you’ll use every day
- Interfacing: importing functions, exporting APIs, and sharing memory with hosts

Further reading:

- Learn by doing with the Watlings exercises: [watlings](https://github.com/EmNudge/watlings)
- Consult the authoritative spec for exact grammar and semantics: [WebAssembly spec (Structure → Syntax)](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/index.html)
