WAT is the human-readable text format of WebAssembly. It mirrors the binary format closely while being friendly enough to read, write, and learn from.

- **[Types](/types/)** — the values functions accept and return
- **[Operators](/operators/)** — core instructions you'll use every day
- **[Interfacing](/interfacing/)** — importing functions, exporting APIs, and sharing memory with hosts
- **[Instruction Reference](/instructions/i32/)** — complete docs for all WebAssembly instructions
